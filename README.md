## Mac Address Lookup
I made this small app to generate Mac addresses because I'm always changing my Mac address, or to lookup a Mac I found during a network scan. 

To use this app, you will need to download the [Pythonista 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?mt=8 "Pythonista 3") app from the Apple App Store.
The database contains 21,896 vendors. 

With this app you can:
  1. Generate a random Mac address
  2. Lookup a Mac address in a database
