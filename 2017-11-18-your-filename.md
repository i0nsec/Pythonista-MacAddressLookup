## Mac Address Lookup v1.0

I made this small app to generate Mac Addresses because I'm always changing my Mac Address. It took me nearly an hour to make it, though if I spend more time on it, I will probably improve the UI and add more Features to it.

To use this App, you will need to download the [Pythonista 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?mt=8 "Pythonista 3") app from the Apple App Store.
The database contains 21,896 Mac vendors.
